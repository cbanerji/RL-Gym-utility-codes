## About:
This repo contains codes relevant to reinforcement learning projects involving Open-AI gym environments.

 + **State dim. redcn.** Performs dimensional reduction on Gyn env. observation space vectors in real time.
  It first trains an autoencoder from data collected by running a random policy in the environment.
